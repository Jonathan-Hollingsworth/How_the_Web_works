HTTP stands for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol"

A URL is essentially a string of data that connects to a server and returns the specified web page

DNS "Domain Name System" translates a given Hostname into an IP address

A query string is the optional final part of a URL and it places information into the request header used during the GET request

The two most common HTTP Verbs are GET(A request that doesn't affect the server) and POST(A request that has a permanent effect on the server)

An HTTP Request is when your browser informs the server that it requires information from it

An HTTP Response in when the server sends the information it recived from an HTTP Request to its destination

An HTTP Header is a piece on specified information sent or recived from a request or response
//Examples include:

1: [somesite.com] is converted into an IP Address
2: Computer is connected to IP Address using the appropriate protocol [http] (In the specified port [default for http is 80])
3: Browser requests [/some/page.html] from the server of the IP Address
4: Server recives the request and responds accordingly
5: The page is loaded from response
